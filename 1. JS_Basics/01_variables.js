// let understand variables:

// const : you cant change

const id = 1212;
let accountMail = "test@gmail.com";
var password = "25252525";
city = "delhi";

// var is not used let is used because let doesnt have problem related in block scope and functional scope:

// id = 4
// if variable is decalred but not assigned any value it will have 'undefind' ouptut
accountMail = "test2@gmail.com"; // chnaged
password = "77777"; // changed
city = "up"; // changed
console.table([id, accountMail, password, city]);
